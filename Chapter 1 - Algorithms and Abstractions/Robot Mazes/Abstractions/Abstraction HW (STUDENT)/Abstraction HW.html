		 * Functions you can use:
		 *		moveForward(): The robot will move forward
		 * 			by one square relative to the direction
		 *			it is currently facing. If you move into 
		 *			a white square, the game continues. 
		 * 			If you move into a gray square, you win.
		 * 			If you try to move into a black square, 
		 *			you lose the game.		 
		 * 
		 *		rotateRight(): The robot will rotate to the
		 *			right relative to its current orientation.
		 * 
		 *		rotateLeft(): The robot will rotate to the
		 *			left relative to its current orientation.
		 *
		 *		goalReached(): The function returns true if
		 *			you have reached the end of the maze. It 
		 *			returns false if you are still in a white
		 *			square. This function can only be called 
		 *			100 times per maze to try to prevent the
		 *			game from crashing.
		 *
		 *		canMove(direction): This function returns true
		 *			if the robot can move in the specified direction
		 *			relative to its current orientation. Otherwise,
		 *			it returns false. You must replace the parameter 
		 *			'direction' with one of the following arguments:
		 *				'forward'
		 *				'backward'
		 *				'left'
		 *				'right'
		 *			Note: you need to include the quotes since this function
		 * 			only accepts a string as its argument.

		/**
		 * INSTRUCTIONS
		 * Solve the maze by creating and utilizing the following two abstractions (functions):
		 *		1. multiMove(num)
		 *			- This function takes a number as a parameter and moves forward the number of spaces given
		 *		2. roundAbout()
		 * 			- This function will complete the 360 degree turns found at each corner.  Each turn can be completed by calling this one function.
		 * Your solution must use a combination of these two functions to complete the maze and finish in the gray box.  You must travel counter-clockwise!
